## My Idea and Design Process

The Idea of this app. was to help refguees who have just been granted access into Australia.

As they have a limited amount of time to find a job & buy a house and car, I thought it would be great if people could hire them and give them a new life in their new country.

##### Trello Board
Below is my Trello board for the ideas I had for the application.

##### Wire-Frames

I chose not to follow my wireframes 100% as I thought some things weren't necessary at the time.
